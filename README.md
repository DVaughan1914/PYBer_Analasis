# PYBer_Analysis
PyBer Ride-share data 
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
V. Isualize has given myself and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we are tasked create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
We created a data summary for the ride sharing data for 3 city types, rural, suburban and Urban. There are some distinctive differences in the data between the cities. From the image below of the data sumary, we can see that there are large differences for how many drivers are in each city type. For rural we can see that we have a total of 78 drivers, for suburban there are 490 drivers and for urban we have a total of 2405 drivers. These numbers are directly linked to the general assumption that the total population for each city type influnces the amount of drivers there are which in turn affects the data overall. 
  Just looking at the average fare per city type we can see that there isnt a large difference between the them. One would thing that the Urban areas would have a higher number for the average fares but its actually the lowest average of $24.52. The higest is the rural areas with $34.62, followed by suburban areas with $30.97. So the size of population for each area didnt reflect in the average fares. I deduct its because of the rate each ride costs for each city type. Rural areas are more dispersed so its save to make an assumption that the rate to travel from one destination to another would cost more than that of the other city types. And the a simialr decuction can be made between Suburban to the urban areas. Urban areas are more desnely populated and each ride would cost less to travel shorter distances. Yes they would have more rides than the other two city types but at a lower cost and distance to travel. The disparity between the city type goes from the least densely populated areas to the most densly popluated (Rural>Suburban>Urban). That order is valid for Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares. As for Average Fare per ride, and Average fare per rider, we see that the Urban areas have the highest average among the 3 city types.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on the data and the analysis resutls, we can safely say that there can be more drivers in the rural areas to balance the averages among the three city types. If there were more drivers the rides would be more dispersed among the drivers thus normalizing the fare percentages. This wouls also affect the total fares, where more rides could be taken, which in turn can positively affect the bottom line for that area. They would generage more money for the business.
